[Know issue]
1.Navigate function sometimes did not work, haven't found where the bug yet.
2.If use the map too fast, the app might be crash. Use google api might solve this problem. (Because we directly access google map tiles now)
3.If your device haven't get the GPS location yet, the app will  be crash. Need get GPS location first.(ex. Use Google map to get location first)

[Enhancement]
1.Replace the OSM api to Google api.
2.Solve GPS location problem.
